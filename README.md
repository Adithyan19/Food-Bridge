ONLINE FOOD DONATION SYSTEM

Food wastage is a significant issue globally, while millions suffer from hunger every day. Despite numerous initiatives, a lack of coordination between food donors (e.g., restaurants, households) and organizations catering to the needy leads to inefficiencies. Real-time matching and tracking of donations are often missing, leading to delays or wastage.
 The Online Food Donation System aims to bridge the gap between food donors and NGOs (or individuals in need) through a centralized platform powered by a database management system. The system will facilitate the seamless collection, distribution, and tracking of food donations. Key features include donor registration, live inventory updates, geolocation-based matching, and notifications. A central database will maintain records of donors, food items, donation schedules, and recipients. Real-time updates will enable efficient allocation of food to the nearest beneficiaries. Queries will allow stakeholders to filter data based on location, food type, and quantity. Additionally, logs will track donations for accountability and reporting. The project will include modules for user and NGO registration, food inventory tracking, and geolocation-based matching schemes.
